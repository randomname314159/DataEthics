    <p>Artificial intelligence, often referred to as A.I., is a buzzword commonly used to refer to machine learned and adaptive programs. The articles consider the potential for these machine learning programs to help in a teaching setting for neurodivergent students or in a business setting for neurodivergent employees, an app designed to guide a student through what amounts to a mini-lesson constructed around the person's learning requirements and preferences. <strong>The potential for such a device is powerful but the development and implementation will need to be carefully applied to avoid alienating the users. This leads me to believe that this is not a device for general use in all cases of neurodivergence, but some other implementation.</strong></p>
    <p>The first issue may be how an artificial intelligence powered tool may diagnose and apply the appropriate procedure for a given person. Is it using a self-diagnosed process? This would likely be unreliable as people often do not know themselves as well as they think, leading to inaccuracies in the app’s procedural alterations to a given set of information. Is it using an in-house constructed test? Again, a similar issue occurs with inaccuracy as it can be hard to grasp the whole picture from a short test and a long test for calibration may also run into similar inaccuracies unless well constructed to not give away what a question is testing for. I have often found that tests can tip their hand on which questions affect a certain measurement, skewing the data as a result due to the meta understanding a person gains from the test. Likely, application of the app would include a mix of these two options plus constant fine tuning and recalibrations using an artificial intelligence system adapting to positive responses.</p>
    <p>That does raise the question of how a simple app gathers information on how a person is responding to what the app outputs. If an app is restricted to user input, it might lack data to hone in on what might be helpful for a person. Taking the other extreme, the app could be completely invasive, harvesting every scrap of information on the person. This would have a better chance of providing precisely what a person needs. However, the chance is not guaranteed, as not everyone keeps their life bound to a computer or phone and the cost of a total lack of privacy will likely be too high to enforce. Therein lies the issue: how can an artificial intelligence system focused on a specific task operate with little information that could be skewed or false? How much information does this system need to take to work well? Should it even adapt at all? But then what is the point of including “Artificial Intelligence” in the title, besides being a fancy word that catches the attention of many people? All in all , I have no idea what the proper solution is. I’m sure smarter than myself will figure something out and the app will work like a dream. Or not; maybe input is really hard to get and the idea struggles to adapt.</p>
