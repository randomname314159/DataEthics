		<h1>HUD Writing</h1>
    <p>These articles focus on Facebook allowing ad companies to discriminate against certain groups. The companies had gained access to wide swathes of personal data without any restrictions. With all of the personal information, these companies proceeded to exclude certain areas from ads, a relatively clear set of discrimination. This highlights a major problem that this generation will need to deal with: data privacy. <strong>As more and more personal information gets added to the internet, it becomes more and more important to secure what little personal information is left private and to slow the spread of personal information that has already been added to the information stream.</strong> This lawsuit is a historic landmark for data privacy as it not only should limit the access to data that should have been private to begin with, but also should aid in limiting the use of discriminatory algorithms in the future. As part of the settlement, Meta must stop using the "Special Ad Audience" tool by December 31, 2022. The company has until December 2022 to develop a new system for housing ads that addresses disparities for race, ethnicity, and sex between advertisers' targeted audiences and the group of Facebook users to whom Meta's personalization algorithms deliver the ads. Under the settlement, Meta will discontinue using the "Special Ad Audience" tool for housing ads, which allegedly relies on a discriminatory algorithm. Meta will also develop a new system to address racial and other disparities caused by its use of personalization algorithms in its ad delivery system for housing ads. The new system will require DOJ approval and court oversight.</p>
