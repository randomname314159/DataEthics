		<h1>AI Writing</h1>
    <p>Hair in games can often define the look and feel of a character. Thus, it is important to have a variety of hairstyles from various ethnicities in order to make as many people as possible feel connected to the game. This is a process that takes research and time but is ultimately rewarding in the long run to support diversity and inclusion. However, character creators often are limited to a certain number of hairstyles in order to prevent overwhelming a player. This raises the question of how does one pick the right number of hairstyles to include in any single game? An increased number of hairstyles available to a player will be fantastic so long as it does not come at the expense of ease of use for a character creator.</p>
    <p>As the video referenced mentions, black hairstyles are incredibly varied, with complexity and variants among each style. These styles alone could probably fill a hefty book. But video games have to account for other ethnicities, and it might just be me, but I am not really looking to look through 500 different hairstyles trying to find the one that fits me specifically. So that raises the question of how many hairstyles are too many hairstyles? This is admitted a rather pedantic logistical question that could be answered with a better sorting system or maybe some way to tab through hairstyles. Though it would be interesting to puzzle out how to sort such a wide variety of hairstyles. After all, 500 hairstyles is a lot of hairstyles. I am not sure if there is a good way to sort through, categorize, and arrange that many hairstyles, but also I am not a game developer. It is not my field of expertise, creating a set of buckets for hairstyles and sorting hairstyles into said buckets. It may be a possibility that developers could consult or bring in hairstylists and barbers. This would be the best way to both learn about hairstyles but also help sort said hairstyles into categories according to some stylistic guidelines. A process along these lines would handle both problems at once while still maintaining accuracy as developers would be in contact with the source of hairstyles.</p>
