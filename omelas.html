 <p>The story of Omelas is a strange one at the best of times and disturbing at the worst of times. It speaks of a utopian city, the titular Omelas, where everyone is happy and provided for. But as a catch, the city’s happiness is built on the requirement of one small child suffering in darkness for their entire life. Some people in Omelas are not content with such conditions and choose to walk away, leading to the title of the passage being appropriately named “Those Who Walk Away From Omelas”. <strong>Omelas is a thought experiment that compares the value of societal good against individual good in a city that seems without technology and yet above it.</strong></p>
  <p>The story begins by describing the utopian state of Omelas. No technology is required outside of what is necessary. Every other technological application used is purely based on preference of the citizens. To me, it seems strange that people would prefer living in a big city with a lack of technology, even when technology is available for nearly free use. This seems to be splitting a strangely specific line. If one wanted to live without technology, then a city seems like a strange place of residence even if it was considered utopia. But if one wants to live with the comforts of technology, Omelas appears lacking. However, it simply be that technology is an enabler for happiness and not a requirement, meaning those in Omelas do not need technology outside of the basics as they are already happy and comfortable. That said, the happiness and comfort can not be overwhelming as there are people who choose to walk away from Omelas. This may be rooted in the fact that all people in Omelas know of the suffering child and this known fact is the greatest and only discomfort in Omelas. This seems to be the root of why people leave Omelas.</p>
  <p>Knowing the child is simply there is not enough for most people to leave though. There is the question of personal good versus societal good. The child suffering is objectively good for society in Omelas as it guarantees the happiness of the society of Omelas and those who inhabit said society. Many people are happy only because of the suffering of the child. Even if a child suffering is unethical in a vacuum, the child in Omelas is seen as ethical because it supports the happiness of all the people in the city. However, not everyone sees the suffering as ethical, preferring to suffer themselves or risk suffering rather than be the cause of a single child suffering. We don’t know what happens to those Omelas. They do not care what happens to themselves. Only the fact that the child will not suffer on their watch matters. Does their leaving change anything? No, probably not. Will they leave all the same for the sake of their conscience? Yes. Should people leave Omelas? Who knows. I certainly don’t.</p>
