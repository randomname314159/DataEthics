    <p>In this summary, we examine the fourth annual report from the Statistical Transparency of Policing (STOP) Program, which analyzes data on officer-initiated traffic and pedestrian stops in Oregon. The report highlights the importance of understanding racial disparities in law enforcement interactions and the methodologies used to examine these disparities. Analyzing data from 148 law enforcement agencies in the state, the report draws from three statistical tests to assess potential racial disparities in stops, stop outcomes, and search findings.
The Oregon Legislature mandated the collection of traffic and pedestrian stop data in 2017, with the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission (CJC) tasked with analyzing the data for potential racial disparities. The mandate required the largest law enforcement agencies to begin collecting data first, followed by medium and smaller agencies in the subsequent years. The STOP Program was created to ensure accurate and complete data collection, minimal impact on law enforcement agencies, and minimal impact on officer safety during the data collection process.
The analysis of stop data in the United States began in the mid-1990s in response to court cases alleging racial bias in policing. Most analyses have relied on population-based benchmarks, comparing the demographic breakdown of stopped individuals to residential census data. However, this approach has been criticized for being overly simplistic and often biased or invalid, as the driving population in a given area is often unrelated to the residential population.
To address these shortcomings, the STOP Program employs three statistical tests to examine potential racial disparities in law enforcement interactions: Decision to Stop Analysis, Stop Outcomes Analysis, and Search Findings Analysis. These tests allow for more precise and less biased estimates of disparities, providing a more comprehensive understanding of potential racial bias in policing.
The Decision to Stop Analysis utilizes natural variations in daylight and darkness to examine the initial decision to stop an individual. It compares stop rates for minority individuals to those for white individuals during the time windows surrounding sunrise and sunset. If minority individuals are more likely to be stopped in daylight when race/ethnicity is easier to detect, it provides evidence of a disparity.
The Stop Outcomes Analysis employs propensity score analysis to explore disparities in stop outcomes, such as citations, searches, or arrests. This test matches stop data between two groups based on all available characteristics, only allowing race/ethnicity to vary between the groups being compared. If, after controlling for various factors, minority individuals are cited, searched, or arrested more often than similarly situated white individuals, it indicates evidence of a disparity.
The Search Findings Analysis compares relative rates of successful searches across racial/ethnic groups. If search decisions by officers are based on race/ethnicity neutral criteria, search success rates should be similar across different racial/ethnic categories. However, if search success rates differ and the search success rates for minority individuals are significantly lower than those reported for white individuals, it suggests evidence of a disparity.
In conclusion, the STOP Program's annual report highlights the significance of understanding racial disparities in law enforcement interactions and the importance of using rigorous methodologies to examine these disparities. By employing multiple statistical tests to assess potential racial disparities in stops, stop outcomes, and search findings, the STOP Program aims to provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the impact of race/ethnicity on law enforcement interactions in Oregon. This data-driven approach is essential for informing policy decisions and fostering greater transparency and trust between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve.
